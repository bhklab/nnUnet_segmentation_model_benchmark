This file demonstrates how to generate a benchmarking dataset from a path
pointing to the location of the test set using the DatasetGenerator class.

WARNING: Before running the dataset generator, please ensure that your system
has enough storage for the benchmarking dataset. The size of the dataset will
be roughly T x S x X where T is the number of unique transforms used, S is the
number of severity levels, and X is the original size of the test set. These
datasets can be quite large, especially for volumetric data.

Please refer to input_file_globbing.py for more detailed examples of how to
generate a list of input files to supply to the dataset generator.
